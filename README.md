# Repository primaily for pinouts signals of retro computer.

This is definitely a work in progress. We hope to create a simple repository of pinout signals for each of the IC pins on retro computers. Focused initially on Commodore 8 bit.

These are very unofficial and should be used for study and education only. If your computer bursts into flames, don't blame our screenshots.

# Contributing

We don't assume that we'll be able to source all of the machines we'd like to, so the community contributions are welcome. Please make an effort to get good images. If you're taking a picture from an analog scope, please include any scale settings.

# Folder structure

For now, we'll do something like the following. If something else becomes apparent to be advantagious then we'll restructure. Don't fret to much about it okay?
